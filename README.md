### Hello there stranger ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sandro, but i go under the moniker [Sandroid](https://sandroid.xyz/).<br/>
I'm a lonesome swiss musician. Abuser of innocent instruments.. or so i'm told ðŸ˜….

You can find my socials here: https://sandroid.music

All repositories here usually relate to things i build that solve a need i have for myself. <br/>
For example:

* I've created a [web based projection mapping framework](https://github.com/sandroidmusic/projector), that can react to [live music and to MIDI events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2pfZ2ajXEs).
* I'm working on [web based second screen solution](https://github.com/sandroidmusic/obs-2nd-Screen) for [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) that is free and web-based.
* Or i create more practical things, like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) Plugins. Which you can find [over here](https://github.com/eatcodeplay).

Feel free to reach out if you got any questions! ðŸ¤—
